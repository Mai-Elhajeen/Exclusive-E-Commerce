# Sections Directory

This directory contains UI sections that are composed of multiple components. Sections are larger building blocks than components but smaller than full pages.

## Structure Guidelines

- Use PascalCase for section names
- Sections should be reusable across different pages
- Group related functionality together

## Suggested Sections:
- `Hero.jsx` - Hero section for homepage
- `FeaturedProducts.jsx` - Featured products showcase
- `Categories.jsx` - Product categories display
- `Testimonials.jsx` - Customer testimonials
- `Newsletter.jsx` - Newsletter signup section
